Project Overview
This project aims to predict the number of calories burned during physical activity based on various features, such as Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart_Rate, and Body_Temp. The project uses a Linear Regression model to make these predictions, with Calories as the target variable.

Dataset
File: final_csv
Features:
Gender: Gender of the individual (encoded as 0 or 1).
Age: Age of the individual.
Height: Height of the individual (in cm).
Weight: Weight of the individual (in kg).
Duration: Duration of the activity (in minutes).
Heart_Rate: Heart rate during the activity (in bpm).
Body_Temp: Body temperature (in Â°C).
Calories: Target variable, representing the calories burned.
Project Structure
Data Preprocessing:

Load and inspect the dataset.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., Gender).
Handle missing values if needed (e.g., fill missing values with the mean).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of features and examine relationships:
Count plot for Gender.
Line plot of Duration vs. Calories to show how calories burned change with time.
Correlation heatmap to examine relationships between features.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and test sets using an 80-20 split.
Use Linear Regression to predict Calories.
Fit the model with the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model's performance.
Generate predictions using both random synthetic samples and real test data to analyze model accuracy.
